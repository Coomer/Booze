    <p>A debug bar for rails</p>
  </header>
  <p>
    I still write traditional Rails apps (not just using Rails as an API for the frontend), and when doing so find it useful to immediately see a query count on generated pages. This allows me to easily detect n+1 queries.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is where <b>booze</b>, a ruby gem I wrote for this, comes into play.
  </p>
  <h3>How it Works</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      A railtie subscribes to ActiveSupport::Notifications to save queries in memory as a controller action runs. Queries are cleared when the action is done performing.
    </li>
    <li>
      The railtie adds an after_filter to display a debug bar right before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.
    </li>
    <li>
      This debug bar has the total query count and can be expanded to show all queries used to render the page.
    </li>
  </ol>
